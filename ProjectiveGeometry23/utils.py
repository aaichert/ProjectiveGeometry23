"""
Utility functions for geometry.

Note that these functions are imported directly to projective_geometry.

Example (compute line through point [2, 1] pointing right):
    import projective_geometry as pg
    pg.join(RP2Point(1, 2, 1), RP2Point(0, 1, 0))

FIXME (?) numpy is awkward with keeping track of row versus column vectors.
          Possibly simplify code to just use 1D arrays?
